# README.md for Tic Tac Toe Final Project
Tic Tac Toe Final Project by Sumya Sultana 

The purpose of my program is to conduct a game of Tic Tac Toe with two players entering their respective moves. The goal of my program was to not only be able to successfully carry out a game of Tic Tac Toe, but to account for illegal moves that would not be possible or allowed when playing the game regularly on pen and paper. One of the "illegal" moves that are accounted for is a player putting their symbol on an occupied space. In a regular game of tic tac toe, a player would not be able to do this. 

The purpose of my notebook is to easily run the code. I included comments to briefly describe each section of code as each algorithm has a specific purpose and set of functions. For instance, longest algorithm is in my while loop which accounts for several possible moves that the player could attempt and what the program will return to the player in response to their input. 

I primarily worked on Google Colaboratory as it was easy to visualize and view errors.
